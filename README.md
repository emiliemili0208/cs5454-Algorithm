# cs5454-Algorithm
Project of this course are implementation and write-up of union-find algorithm.  
There are four different union-find algorithms: quick-find, quick-union, weighted union and path compressed.  
And using python to implement each kind of algorithm.  
The details comparison and introduction of algorithms are presented in paper.
